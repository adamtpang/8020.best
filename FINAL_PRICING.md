## ðŸ“Š Technical Limits

### Per Analysis Call
- **Max tasks**: 1,000 items
- **Max characters**: 1,000,000 characters
- **Batch processing**: 10 tasks at a time (AI token limit)

### Example Analysis Costs
- 10 tasks = 1 API call to Replicate (~$0.01)
- 50 tasks = 5 API calls (~$0.05)
- 100 tasks = 10 API calls (~$0.10)

### Cost Analysis at $5/month
```
User does 50 runs/month @ 50 tasks each:
- API cost: 50 runs Ã— $0.05 = $2.50
- Your revenue: $5.00
- Gross profit: $2.50 (50% margin)

User does 100 runs/month @ 50 tasks each:
- API cost: 100 runs Ã— $0.05 = $5.00
- Your revenue: $5.00
- Gross profit: $0.00 (break-even)

User does 200 runs/month @ 50 tasks each:
- API cost: 200 runs Ã— $0.05 = $10.00
- Your revenue: $5.00
- Gross profit: -$5.00 (loss)
```

### Why 500/month Soft Cap Works
- Most users will do 10-50 runs/month (high margin)
- Power users at 100-200 runs/month (break-even to small loss)
- Soft cap at 500 prevents extreme losses
- Hard cap at 1000 blocks abuse

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics to Track

### Week 1
- Total signups
- Free tier conversion rate (target: 2%+)
- Average runs per free user
- Any 1000+ run abuse cases

### Month 1
- MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Average runs per paid user
- Churn rate
- Gross margin (target: >50%)

### Adjustments
- If conversion < 2%: Increase perceived value (speed, features)
- If avg paid user > 200 runs/month: Consider raising price to $7-10
- If abuse cases: Lower hard cap to 500
- If margin < 50%: Reduce soft cap or add usage-based pricing
